# ATMs Interface Improvement
**Evaluation and Enhancement of ONCF Automated Ticket Machines Interface**

As part of our UI/UX project at INPT, we evaluated and enhanced the interface of ONCF’s automated ticket machines. Through detailed analysis, a paper prototype, and a digital prototype created in Axure, our goal was to make the interface more intuitive and efficient for users.

---

## Methodology:

To achieve our objective, we followed this structured methodology:
- **Interface Evaluation:** Conducted a heuristic evaluation of the automated ticket machine interface using Nielsen’s principles.
- **User Testing:** Organized user testing sessions to observe and collect feedback on real-world usage.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzed data from user tests and heuristic evaluations.
- **Axure Prototyping:** Created a digital prototype in Axure to present the improved interface.

## Statistical Study

The results provided valuable insights into potential issues, forming the foundation for a statistical analysis aimed at improving user experience with ONCF’s automated ticket machines.

### Key Findings:
Most respondents fall into the youth and adult age brackets. Surprisingly, 42% had never used ONCF ticket machines. This raises the question: why has such a significant portion avoided using them? Below are the responses that provide some insights:

Participants showed a high education level. While 40% found the ticket machines moderately easy to use, 10% considered them difficult. To understand their challenges, we conducted interviews and gathered the following responses:

## Evaluation of Interfaces

### Evaluation of the First Interface:
<img src="Images/eval-1.jpg" alt="First Interface" width="300px">
*Figure 2.5: First Interface*

- **Positioning Standards:** Observed consistent placement of interface elements, with languages in the top left and the ONCF logo at the bottom right, ensuring a visually cohesive structure.
- **Logo Visibility:** The white-colored ONCF logo had low contrast against the gray background, highlighting the need for better color contrast.
- **Real-World Alignment:** Certain phrases (e.g., "Dat76" or "immediate departure") may confuse users, stressing the importance of universally understandable language.

### Evaluation of the Second Interface:

*Figure 2.6: Second Interface*

- **Aesthetic and Minimal Design:** Multiple tasks (4 in total) increase user cognitive load, emphasizing the need for simplification.
- **Design Consistency:** Icons (e.g., cancel, back, next) need a more uniform appearance. Additionally, two gray buttons appeared disabled, causing confusion.
- **Help and Documentation:** Lack of guidance for critical tasks highlights the need for contextual help or accessible documentation.

### Evaluation of the Third Interface:

*Figure 2.7: Third Interface*

- **Affordance Issues:** The option to change the station ("Other Destinations") was not intuitive. Improving clarity in functionality can enhance usability.

---

### Evaluation of the Fourth Interface:

*Figure 2.8: Fourth Interface*

- **Efficiency:** Redundant destination selection functionality appeared at multiple interface levels, adding unnecessary complexity.

---

### Evaluation of the Fifth Interface:
<img src="Images/eval-5.jpg" alt="Fifth Interface" width="300px">
*Figure 2.9: Fifth Interface*

- **Aesthetic Design:** Button text added cognitive load. Simplifying labels can enhance clarity and usability.
- **Visibility Issues:** Low contrast between gray and white symbols made elements difficult to distinguish. Adjusting the color palette is recommended.

---

### Evaluation of the Sixth Interface:
<img src="Images/eval-6.jpg" alt="Sixth Interface" width="300px">
*Figure 2.10: Sixth Interface*

- **User Control and Freedom:** The absence of a search bar and flexible navigation options limited usability.
- **Cognitive Load:** Simplifying task instructions can reduce mental effort and improve interactions.

---

### Evaluation of the Seventh Interface:
<img src="Images/eval-7.jpg" alt="Seventh Interface" width="300px">
*Figure 2.11: Seventh Interface*

- **Flexibility:** Restricting access without completing mandatory fields reduced user flexibility. Allowing partial access while providing guidance can improve the experience.

# Digital Prototype (Axure)

This Axure prototype lays the foundation for the future implementation of the improved ONCF (National Railways Office) ATM interface. The color palette is inspired by the ONCF logo.
